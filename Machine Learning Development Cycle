**4. Evaluation:**

- **Metrics Selection:**
  - Choose relevant evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) based on project goals.

- **Model Performance:**
  - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set to estimate its generalization to new, unseen data.

- **Iterative Refinement:**
  - If necessary, refine the model or revisit earlier stages based on evaluation results.

---

**5. Deployment:**

- **Scalability:**
  - Ensure that the model can handle real-world usage, considering factors like concurrent user load.
