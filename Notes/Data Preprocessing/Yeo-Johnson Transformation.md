The Yeo-Johnson transformation is a modification of the Box-Cox transformation, designed to handle both positive and negative values, including zero. It is commonly used in statistics and data analysis to stabilize variance and make data more closely approximate a normal distribution. The transformation is defined by a parameter, lambda (λ), which determines the type of transformation applied.

Here's a note on the Yeo-Johnson transformation:

**Yeo-Johnson Transformation:**

The Yeo-Johnson transformation is a powerful tool in statistical analysis, particularly for addressing non-constant variance and non-normality in data. Developed as an extension of the Box-Cox transformation, the Yeo-Johnson transformation accommodates both positive and negative values, making it more versatile.

**Key Features:**

1. **Handling Negative Values:**
   Unlike the original Box-Cox transformation, the Yeo-Johnson transformation can handle datasets that include zero and negative values. This flexibility is crucial when working with diverse datasets.

2. **Parameterized Transformation:**
   The transformation is governed by a parameter, lambda (λ), which can take any real value. The choice of λ determines the type and strength of the transformation applied. For λ = 0, the Yeo-Johnson transformation becomes the natural logarithm, and for λ = 1, it becomes the identity transformation.

3. **Normalizing Variance:**
   One of the primary purposes of the Yeo-Johnson transformation is to stabilize variance across the dataset. This is particularly useful in statistical modeling, where assumptions of homoscedasticity are important.

4. **Improved Normality:**
   By accounting for both positive and negative values, the Yeo-Johnson transformation aids in making data more closely approximate a normal distribution. This is valuable for techniques and models that assume normality, such as linear regression.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

The Yeo-Johnson transformation of a variable \(x\) is given by:

\[ y =
\begin{cases}
\left((x + 1)^{\lambda} - 1\right) / \lambda & \text{if } x \geq 0, \lambda \neq 0 \\
\ln(x + 1) & \text{if } x \geq 0, \lambda = 0 \\
-\left((-x + 1)^{\lambda} - 1\right) / \lambda & \text{if } x < 0, \lambda \neq 0 \\
-\ln(-x + 1) & \text{if } x < 0, \lambda = 0 \\
\end{cases}
\]

**Conclusion:**

In summary, the Yeo-Johnson transformation is a valuable tool for data preprocessing, especially when dealing with datasets that exhibit heteroscedasticity and departures from normality. Its ability to handle a wide range of data distributions makes it a versatile choice in statistical analysis and modeling.
