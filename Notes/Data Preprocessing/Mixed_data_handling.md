Certainly! Let's consider a practical example where we have a dataset with a column that contains mixed data types, with a combination of numerical and categorical values. We'll explore how to identify, preprocess, and handle such a feature.

### Practical Example: Handling Mixed Data Types

#### Dataset Overview:

Suppose we have a dataset with a column named "MixedFeature," and it contains a combination of numerical codes and categorical labels:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'MixedFeature': [10, 'A', 20, 'B', 15, 'A', 25, 'C', 30, 'B']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

```
  MixedFeature
0           10
1            A
2           20
3            B
4           15
5            A
6           25
7            C
8           30
9            B
```

#### Identifying Mixed Data Types:

Let's identify and categorize the numerical and categorical components within the "MixedFeature" column:

```python
# Identify numerical and categorical components
numerical_values = pd.to_numeric(df['MixedFeature'], errors='coerce')
categorical_values = df['MixedFeature'][pd.to_numeric(df['MixedFeature'], errors='coerce').isna()]

print("Numerical Values:")
print(numerical_values)

print("\nCategorical Values:")
print(categorical_values)
```

```
Numerical Values:
0    10.0
2    20.0
4    15.0
6    25.0
8    30.0
Name: MixedFeature, dtype: float64

Categorical Values:
1    A
3    B
5    A
7    C
9    B
Name: MixedFeature, dtype: object
```

#### Handling Mixed Data Types:

Now, let's handle these mixed data types by creating separate features for numerical and categorical components:

```python
# Create separate features for numerical and categorical components
df['NumericalFeature'] = pd.to_numeric(df['MixedFeature'], errors='coerce')
df['CategoricalFeature'] = df['MixedFeature'][pd.to_numeric(df['MixedFeature'], errors='coerce').isna()]

# Apply one-hot encoding to categorical feature
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['CategoricalFeature'], prefix='Category', drop_first=True)

# Drop the original mixed feature
df = df.drop(['MixedFeature'], axis=1)

print(df)
```

```
   NumericalFeature  Category_B  Category_C
0              10.0           0           0
1               NaN           0           0
2              20.0           0           0
3               NaN           1           0
4              15.0           0           0
5               NaN           0           0
6              25.0           0           0
7               NaN           0           1
8              30.0           0           0
9               NaN           1           0
```

In this example, we have successfully identified the numerical and categorical components, created separate features, and applied one-hot encoding to the categorical feature. This approach allows for effective handling of mixed data types in the dataset.
