**Definition:**
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms allowing computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves the extraction of patterns from data, enabling systems to improve performance through experience.

---

**Key Principles:**
1. **Data-Driven Learning:** ML relies on data to train models, emphasizing the importance of high-quality and diverse datasets.
2. **Algorithmic Adaptation:** ML algorithms adjust and improve over time based on input data and feedback.
3. **Generalization:** ML models aim to perform well on new, unseen data, showcasing their ability to generalize patterns.
4. **Feedback Mechanisms:** Continuous learning and refinement are achieved through feedback loops.

**Types of Machine Learning:**

1. **Supervised Learning:**
   - Involves training models on labeled datasets with input-output pairs.
   - Examples: Image classification (identifying objects in images), Predictive analytics (stock price prediction).

2. **Unsupervised Learning:**
   - Deals with unlabeled data, discovering patterns or relationships.
   - Examples: Clustering (grouping similar data points), Dimensionality reduction (simplifying data while retaining important features).

3. **Reinforcement Learning:**
   - Focuses on agents making decisions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.
   - Examples: Game-playing AI (AlphaGo), Robot control.
