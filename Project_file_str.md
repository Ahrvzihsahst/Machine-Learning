In an Agile-driven machine learning project hosted on GitHub, the file structure should be organized to support collaboration, version control, and seamless integration into the Agile development lifecycle. Below is a suggested file structure:

```
project-root/
│
├── data/
│   ├── raw/                   # Raw data files
│   ├── processed/             # Processed data files
│   └── interim/               # Intermediate data files
│
├── notebooks/                 # Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
│
├── src/
│   ├── data_preprocessing/    # Scripts for data preprocessing
│   ├── feature_engineering/   # Scripts for feature engineering
│   ├── model_training/        # Scripts for training machine learning models
│   └── evaluation/            # Scripts for model evaluation and validation
│
├── models/                    # Saved model files
│
├── docs/                      # Documentation files
│   ├── requirements.txt       # Project dependencies
│   └── README.md              # Project README
│
├── tests/                     # Unit tests
│
├── .gitignore                 # Gitignore file
├── LICENSE                    # Project license file
└── .github/
    ├── workflows/             # GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
    └── pull_request_template/ # Pull request templates
```

Explanation:

- **`data/`:** Store raw, processed, and interim data in separate directories to maintain a clean data pipeline.

- **`notebooks/`:** Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and experimentation.

- **`src/`:** Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific stage in the machine learning pipeline.

- **`models/`:** Save trained machine learning models in this directory.

- **`docs/`:** Documentation, including a `README.md` file with project information and dependencies.

- **`tests/`:** Unit tests to ensure the functionality of your code.

- **`.gitignore`:** List of files or directories to be ignored by version control.

- **`LICENSE`:** Project license file.

- **`.github/`:** GitHub-specific configurations.
  - **`workflows/`:** GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD).
  - **`pull_request_template/`:** Templates for pull requests.

This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, makes collaboration easier, and facilitates integration into CI/CD workflows. Adjustments can be made based on specific project requirements and team preferences.
