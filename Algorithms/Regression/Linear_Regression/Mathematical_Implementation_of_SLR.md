The mathematical implementation of Simple Linear Regression involves estimating the parameters (\(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\)) of the linear equation \(Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \varepsilon\) based on the given dataset. The goal is to find the values of \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) that minimize the sum of squared residuals. Here's the step-by-step mathematical process:

### **1. Objective Function:**

The objective is to minimize the sum of squared residuals:

\[ \text{Minimize } \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1x_i))^2 \]

### **2. Partial Derivatives:**

Take the partial derivatives of the objective function with respect to \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) and set them to zero:

\[ \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta_0} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1x_i))^2 = 0 \]

\[ \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta_1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1x_i))^2 = 0 \]

### **3. Equations for \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\):**

Solving the partial derivatives, we get the following equations:

\[ \beta_0 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})(x_i - \bar{x})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \]

\[ \beta_1 = \bar{y} - \beta_0 \bar{x} \]

Where:
- \(\bar{y}\) is the mean of the dependent variable \(Y\),
- \(\bar{x}\) is the mean of the independent variable \(X\).

### **4. Predictions:**

Once \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) are estimated, predictions (\(Y_{\text{pred}}\)) can be made for new values of \(X\) using the equation:

\[ Y_{\text{pred}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1X \]

### **5. Coefficient of Determination (R-squared):**

R-squared is calculated as:

\[ R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - Y_{\text{pred}})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2} \]

### **Summary:**

The key steps involve finding the partial derivatives, setting them to zero, solving for \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\), making predictions, and evaluating the model's performance using metrics like R-squared.

It's worth noting that these equations assume the basic linear regression model assumptions are met, including linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals. The calculations can be performed using statistical software or programming languages like Python or R.
